MCP stands for Model Context Protocol. It is an open standard protocol designed to enable AI applications, especially large language models (LLMs) and AI agents, to communicate seamlessly with external systems, data sources, and tools. MCP acts like a "USB-C port for AI," providing standardized pathways for AI to interact with and perform actions using external resources through natural language, without the need for manual coding or complex integrations.

How MCP Works
1. MCP uses a client-server architecture where:
MCP Hosts are AI applications (like Anthropic's Claude or AI-powered IDEs).
2. MCP Clients in the host communicate with MCP Servers.
3. MCP Servers act as intermediaries exposing external systems (databases, APIs, filesystems, business tools) with defined capabilities
4. Communication happens via a standardized JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol over transports such as STDIO or HTTP+SSE.

This protocol enables AI to discover what tools and data sources are available, request access, exchange information, and integrate external real-time or proprietary data into their responses efficiently.
