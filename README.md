**Diffusion Models (Stable Diffusion, MidJourney)**

“These are AI models that create images by gradually ‘filling in noise’ until a clear picture forms. Think of them as the tech behind text-to-image tools like MidJourney or Stable Diffusion.”

**Prompt Engineering (zero-shot, few-shot, CoT)**

“This is how we phrase questions to get better answers from AI. Zero-shot means no examples, few-shot means we give examples, and Chain-of-Thought is guiding the AI to explain its reasoning step by step.”

**RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**

“RAG lets an AI pull in external knowledge, like from your company’s documents, so the answers are accurate and up to date instead of just relying on what the model was trained on.”
- RAG vs Fine-tuning (when to use) : “Use RAG when your data changes often — it’s cheaper and faster. Fine-tuning makes sense if you need the model to deeply ‘learn’ your data or perform in a very specialized way.”

**Agents / Orchestration (LangChain, LlamaIndex, AutoGPT, MCP)**

“Instead of just answering, agents can plan tasks, call APIs, or use tools. Frameworks like LangChain or MCP connect models to systems so AI can actually ‘do things’ end-to-end.”

**MCP (Model Context Protocol) – standard for tool/agent interoperability**

“This is an open standard that lets AI models talk to tools and data in a consistent way. It’s like a universal adapter so different AIs and apps can plug into each other safely.”

**Agentic AI**

"It refers to AI systems that act like agents — they don’t just answer questions, they can take actions, make decisions, and use tools on your behalf to achieve a goal."

**Multimodal AI (text, image, video, speech together)**

“These models can understand and generate across different formats — text, images, audio, even video. For example, asking an AI to describe an image, then turn that into a narrated video.”

**Fine-tuning vs LoRA**

“Fine-tuning retrains a model so it learns new skills, but it’s heavy and expensive. LoRA is a lightweight version that makes small, efficient adjustments — faster and cheaper for customizing models.”
